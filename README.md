# Description and types of tests

This project is one of the projects that I wanted to spend time testing on postman using various methods like: POST, GET, DELETE ... using different types of data like: json, text, image, sounds;

As in the project I had used the configuration of cookies to authenticate, it was necessary to test them because to reach other details it was necessary to authenticate. In order to obtain access and refresh token you had to use the appropriate method like POST. Once we have obtained these tokens, we can now move on to other tests in order to use them if necessary.
We tested the images and videos if it is possible to integrate them into the project;

we add the slugs and other constituents in objects that we created during configuration;

we tested the filters with different types of cases that we specified during configuration;

we tested the search for products by their keywords and to see if the product exists or not and if it exists that this product is displayed on the screen otherwise, it could display an empty message;

We tested the sending of messages by the visitor to the company in case he was interested in the product;

we have again tested on a multitude of agents on this platform, who manages to distinguish themselves by making more sales, who follows it with what rate, and who is not progressing too well with what score;

in our database we have created two types of user: visitors and sellers:
sellers are those who have the right to publish their content and visitors will come to visit and if they are interested, they can contact the owner to make an appointment. In both cases of users, the Admin has all the rights to delete a user whether it is a seller or an already authenticated visitor
